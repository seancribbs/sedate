"sedate" is an attempt to clone Cucumber, the awesome Ruby library for acceptance testing, using Erlang-specific idioms.

DONE:
* Parse gherkin (with neotoma).
* Collect step definitions from files.

IN PROGRESS:
* Use smerl to dynamically add stepdefs to a "world" module.

TODO:
* Sensible expectation/assertion library.
* Execute collected steps against the story AST.
* Command-line helpers, perhaps via rebar.
* Project templates/generators.
